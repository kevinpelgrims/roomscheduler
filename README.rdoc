This is just a simple little project to play around with Rails 4 (using Ruby 2.0.0).

The main technical goal was to get to know Rails 4 and how it generates JSON.
The calendar control used consumes JSON directly, which is one of the reasons for choosing it (to keep things simple).

The practical goal was to manage a shared meeting room in the office.
There was no system in place and people would never know if the meeting room was busy or not and when it would become available.
